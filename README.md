# Regex Prime Numbers

A little program to determine if a number is prime using regular expressions.

I saw this pretty cool video on YouTube about using regular expressions to determine if a number is prime. I thought it was pretty cool so I decided to try it out myself. 

Here is the video:

It's based on this article:

You can copy or save the prime numbers to a file. Just click the `Save` button, or press `Ctrl + S`. The file will be saved in the same directory as the program. The file will be named `Primes-<date-timestamp>.txt`. Click the copy button to copy whatever textbox your cursor is in. 

You can download a compiled version of the program under "Releases" on the right side of the page.
